## What does it do
It helps to see your progress in passing necessary subjects in MUNI. It will highlight your subjects and you will see very nicely what you should take to finish the study

## How does it work
It takes your marks and highlights subjects in your template.
Meaning: 
* Green color - You passed this subject (at least once)
* Red color - You failed this subject (and have no successfull trial)
* Blue color - You have this subject, but it is not marked yet

## How to use it
1. Find file named `main.js` in this repo
1. Now go to your template (it should be something like `https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmety/sablony?fakulta=1433;obdobi=9223;uzel=2592712;rek=a`)
    1. Go to [Šablony](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmety/sablony) -> `Kontrolní šablony` -> Find your study (e.g. `B-CS Kyberbezpečnost - 2022/2023`). Its year should be the year you APPLIED to the study
    1. You will work here
1. Open `Developer Console` in your browser (usually `F12`)
1. Find `Console` tab and select it
1. Copy `main.js` contents and paste it to console
